# kcnr-v-internationalization

* This repository houses all the language files for KCNR:V.

# New languages

* Language files are stored as `language_code.json`.
* You may create new language files, they will not be automatically added to the game.
* When adding new language files, inform a developer at our [Discord Server](https://www.discord.me/kcnr) in order for it to be enabled in-game.

## PLEASE NOTE

* There are ***2*** sets of language files that must be translated. One in the main folder, and another in `browsers/language_code.json`. Please be mindful of this when translating!

# Requirements / Rules

* %% is the insert placeholder, where the game shall replace %% with informational text, you MUST put these %% placeholders respectively back in place in the language that you are editing (THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT).
* Colour codes are wrapped between tidles i.e (~code~). These follow the same suit as the placeholders, they MUST be put back.
* Language keys must be sorted in alphabetical order (This does not affect the game, but allows us contributors to handle the keys more easily).
* All changes must be done via pull request and summary and description of what was done MUST be descriptive enough for English users to understand.
* Language files are in JSON format, they must STAY in JSON format.
* Any request that does not meet these requirements will be denied until fixed.
